Let's address each point:

1. Unavailability of Monitoring in Vespa Clusters:
   - This API collects the data on metrics related to performance, utilization, and overall health of Vespa cluster. External tools, like Grafana, can be used for visualization, making it easier to interpret and analyze the collected metrics.

2. No clarity on Horizontal Scalability in Vespa Architecture:
   - Vespa achieves horizontal scalability by allowing to distribute data across multiple nodes. The data is divided into partitions, and each partition is handled by a separate Vespa node. This horizontal scaling strategy enables Vespa to handle large volumes of data and query loads efficiently. As the data or query load increases, we can add more nodes to the Vespa cluster to distribute the workload and maintain performance.

3. Unavailability of Resource Allocation Policy in Vespa:
   - Vespa provides mechanisms to allocate resources effectively. The resource allocation policy can be configured through the Vespa application package. This can control the number of content nodes, adjust the number of partitions, and allocate resources like memory and CPU for each node. Tuning these parameters allows to optimize the performance of Vespa cluster based on specific workload and hardware resources.

4. Security of Vespa RESTful APIs:
   - Vespa RESTful APIs can be secured through various mechanisms:
     - TLS Encryption: You can enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between clients and Vespa, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
     - Authentication: Vespa supports authentication mechanisms, allowing you to control access to RESTful APIs based on user credentials or API keys.
     - Authorization: You can configure authorization policies to specify what actions different users or systems are allowed to perform through the RESTful APIs.

5. Cloud-Based Data Storage Strategy and Policies:
   - Vespa can be deployed in cloud environments, and the choice of data storage strategy often depends on the cloud provider. Vespa supports integration with cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. The specific storage strategy and associated policies (such as data replication and backup policies) will depend on your cloud provider's capabilities and best practices.

6. Historical data migration approach :  
Based on my understanding, opting for the real-time channel to migrate historical data is more time-consuming and potentially costly approach compared to leveraging the efficiency of tools such as "dsbulk" for Cassandra and the "Vespa feed" for Vespa. The batch-oriented nature and parallel processing capabilities of these tools can often lead to faster and more resource-efficient data migration when dealing with large datasets.

To export data from cassandra : dsbulk load -url data.csv -k keyspace -t table
To import data into vespa : vespa-feed --verbose --file data.csv


Kafka

7. Limitation to Handle Larger Message 
Kafka brokers have their own limitations that can impact the size of messages they can handle. So far only maximum 1MB is required. However, we can change this behaviour by setting up below configuarations message.max.bytes , max.request.size, fetch.message.max.bytes

8. Customized or Correct Serializers can improve the performace drastically.

Docker :

9. Making all b360 apis/components docker ready would be best approach for future releases.

Integration Test:

10. I am of the opinion that utilizing Robot Framework (https://robotframework.org/) for automated testing has the potential to enhance overall quality.

Kotlin :

1. Creating all DTOs, Entities, and POJOs dynamically(runtime  based getter/setter fuctions) in Kotlin could enhance code flexibility and make refactoring more straightforward.
