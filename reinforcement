Approach to incorporate "Fine Tuning" or "Feedback/Rating" in LLM : 

LLM Version : 3.5 Turbo
Descrition : Fine tuning is now available for GPT-3.5-Turbo, Babbage-002, and Davinci-002 in Public Preview

The general approach to incorporate user feedback/rating to retrain the model would typically involve the following steps:

1. Collect User Feedback: As show in previous PoC, we would collect feedback/rating from users and store them in Mongo Database. If these ratings are greate than 3.5 will mark them as "good" or otherwise "bad." 
The accumulated datasets, including user inputs, model-generated responses, and associated feedbacks would be used later for fine-tuning.

2. Preprocess and Annotate Data: Prepare the collected data for training. This may involve tokenizing text, structuring it in a way that the model can understand, and adding annotations that indicate feedback, e.g., labeling responses as "positive" or "negative."

4. Use Fine-tuning or Reinforcement Learning  to Train the Model: Use the prepared dataset to train the model. This would involve running training iterations, adjusting model parameters, and allowing the model to learn from the feedback data.

5. Evaluate and Iterate: After fine-tuning, we would evaluate the model's performance to ensure that it has improved based on the feedback. If necessary, iterate the fine-tuning process to further improve the model.
