aCreating a complete Vespa application from scratch is a multi-step process. I can provide you with a simplified example of a Vespa application that you can use as a starting point. In this example, we'll create a basic Vespa application to index and search documents. Note that a production-ready Vespa application may have a more complex setup.

Here's a simple Vespa application example:

1. Create a Vespa Application Package:

First, create a directory for your Vespa application and navigate to it in your terminal.

```bash
mkdir my-vespa-app
cd my-vespa-app
```

2. Define the Document Schema:

Create a file named `schemas/music.sd` and define a document schema for your application. In this example, we'll create a "music" document with two fields: "title" and "artist."

```plaintext
schema music {
    document music {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index | summary
        }
        field artist type string {
            indexing: index | summary
        }
    }

    indexing {
        index: enable
    }
}
```

3. Create an Application Configuration:

Create a file named `src/main/application/services.xml` to define your Vespa application configuration. Here's a minimal example:

```xml
<services version="1.0">
    <container id="default" version="1.0">
        <search />
    </container>
</services>
```

4. Indexing Data:

You can manually create a sample JSON document for indexing in a file named `music.json`. For example:

```json
{
  "put": "id:music:music::1",
  "fields": {
    "title": "Song 1",
    "artist": "Artist A"
  }
}
```

To index this document, you can use the `vespa-feed` tool:

```bash
vespa-feed < music.json
```

5. Deploy the Application:

Deploy the Vespa application by running:

```bash
vespa-deploy prepare /path/to/your/application-package
vespa-deploy activate
```

6. Query the Application:

You can use the Vespa query language to search for documents. For example:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/search/?yql=select%20%2A%20from%20sources%20%2A%3B"
```

This is a very basic example to get you started. In a real-world scenario, you'd have a more complex schema, data ingestion processes, and likely multiple services. You can explore Vespa's documentation for more in-depth information: https://docs.vespa.ai/
