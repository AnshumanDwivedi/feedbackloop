Creating a full GraphQL project with Kotlin and Spring Boot requires several steps. I'll provide you with a basic outline of how to set up a sample project, but keep in mind that you'll need to create the necessary files and configurations to complete the project.

1. **Create a Spring Boot Project**:
   You can create a Spring Boot project using your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) or by using Spring Initializer. Ensure that you select Kotlin as the programming language.

2. **Add Dependencies**:
   In your `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` file, add the following dependencies for Spring Boot and GraphQL:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter")
       implementation("com.graphql-java-kickstart:graphql-spring-boot-starter:11.0.0")
       implementation("com.graphql-java-kickstart:graphql-java-tools:11.0.0")
   }
   ```

3. **Create a GraphQL Schema**:
   Create a GraphQL schema file (e.g., `schema.graphqls`) in your project's resources directory. Define your GraphQL types and queries in this file.

   ```graphql
   type Query {
       hello: String
   }
   ```

4. **Create a GraphQL Resolver**:
   Create a Kotlin class to define resolvers for your GraphQL schema. For the above schema, you might create a class like this:

   ```kotlin
   import graphql.kickstart.tools.GraphQLQueryResolver
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

   @Component
   class QueryResolver : GraphQLQueryResolver {
       fun hello(): String {
           return "Hello, GraphQL!"
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure GraphQL in Spring Boot**:
   Create a configuration class to enable GraphQL in your Spring Boot application:

   ```kotlin
   import graphql.kickstart.spring.web.boot.GraphQLWebAutoConfiguration
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import

   @Configuration
   @Import(GraphQLWebAutoConfiguration::class)
   class GraphQLConfig
   ```

6. **Run Your Application**:
   Run your Spring Boot application. You can do this by running the `main` function in your main application class.

7. **Test Your GraphQL API**:
   You can test your GraphQL API by making POST requests to the endpoint, usually at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`. You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or any GraphQL client to send queries. For example:

   ```graphql
   {
       hello
   }
   ```

   This should return a response with "Hello, GraphQL!".

This is a basic example to get you started with a GraphQL project using Kotlin and Spring Boot. Depending on your project requirements, you may need to add more types, mutations, and complex resolvers. You can also consider using a GraphQL client library to interact with your API from the frontend.
